$ grep "CLUE" crimescene
CLUE: Footage from an ATM security camera is blurry but shows that the perpetrator is at least 6' tall.
CLUE: Found a wallet believed to belong to the killer: no ID, just loose change, and membership cards for AAA, Delta SkyMiles, the local library, and the Museum of Bash History. The cards are totally untraceable and have no name, for some reason.
CLUE: Questioned the barista at the local coffee shop. He said a person left right before they heard the shots. The name on their latte was Annabel, they had blond spiky hair and a New Zealand accent.

In order to track down our potential witness we need to figure out where they live. 
Try using 'head' on some of the files like 'people' and 'vehicles' and see where we might find that.

Notice that not all of the results are worth investigating.  Remember what we know about Annabel.

"Interview" the two possible witnesses by reading the correct line from the streets they live on:

        head -n 173 streets/Mattapan_Street | tail -n 1

This will give you just line 173 of Mattapan street, because it will take first 173 lines, and then take
the last line from those.

To find a matching license plate, or a matching car, you can use grep on the 'vehicles' file:

        grep "Honda" vehicles

        grep "Blue" vehicles

        grep "L337" vehicles

This doesn't give us anything useful - why not? Try using 'head' on the file to investigate its structure.

In order to actually get information about vehicles that might match our description,
we need to get multiple lines AROUND each match.  We can use the -A, -B, or -C option with grep:

        grep -A 5 "L337" mystery/vehicles

This will match the license plates that contain "L337" and, for each match, show us the five lines AFTER it.

To see who was a member of several different groups, you can combine their membership lists into one and search against that.

        cat Fitness_Galaxy AAA United_MileagePlus | grep "John Smith"

If you only want to see the number of matches, you can use grep's -c option (the c must be lowercase):

        cat Fitness_Galaxy AAA United_MileagePlus | grep -c "John Smith"

Or you can pipe the result to 'wc -l':
